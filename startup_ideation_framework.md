# Startup Ideation & Evaluation Framework

This document outlines the systematic approach, criteria, and goals for generating, validating, and executing 10 high-quality side project startup ideas. As the project manager, our objective is to move extremely fast, build software efficiently, and find ideas that can quickly generate significant revenue.

## 1. Core Objective & The "Speed to MRR" Goal
- **Revenue Target:** The primary metric for success is reaching **$10,000 USD/month in revenue per project as quickly as possible** (ideally within 2 months of launch).
- **Speed Over Scale (Initially):** An idea that can predictably generate $10k/month in 2 months is drastically better than one that *might* generate $100k/month after 1 year of grinding.
- **Fail Fast:** We will launch 1-2 MVPs per month. We evaluate market reactions rapidly and ruthlessly kill ideas that don't gain traction.

## 2. Product Constraints & Focus Areas
- **Medium:** Software only.
- **Core Technology:** **AI should be the center of our search.** AI is currently the largest technological shift and provides the most immediate opportunities for automation, personalization, and high-margin software.
- **Niche Focus:** Do not build generic solutions. Instead, find a highly specific, niche topic where people are already eager or willing to pay, and address their precise problem exceptionally well.

## 3. Target Audience & Ticket Sizes
Our goal is speed to revenue. Because of this, we must align our target audience with our minimal distribution connections and need for fast sales cycles:
- **B2Small Business (B2SMB) & Prosumers:** This is the sweet spot. Aim for small businesses where the owner/founder is the direct decision-maker (e.g., local law firms, dental clinics, solo-preneurs, real estate agents). The sales cycle is short, and they have the budget if you save them time or make them money.
- **B2C (Consumers):** Proceed with caution. Consumers can be acquired quickly, but monetizing consumer apps is notoriously difficult. Consumers are often reluctant to pay, and free/cheap alternatives abound. If venturing into B2C, ensuring absolute *clear, undeniable value* that warrants a subscription or one-off purchase is mandatory. Look for tech-forward early adopters willing to try new AI products.
- **AVOID Large Enterprise (B2B):** No government defense contracts. No trying to sell to Walmart or Fortune 500s. Enterprise sales cycles take 6–18 months, require massive compliance (SOC2), and are completely antithetical to our "launch 1-2 a month" goal.

## 4. The Y-Combinator Idea Validation Filter
In drawing from incubators like Y Combinator (YC), we will evaluate our brainstormed ideas using their foundational criteria. YC's core philosophy is to **"Make something people want."** To ensure we do, every problem we target should ideally possess most of the following characteristics:
- **Popular:** Are a lot of people having this problem?
- **Growing:** Is the market for this solution expanding rapidly?
- **Urgent:** Do people need it solved immediately? (e.g., Hair-on-fire problems).
- **Expensive:** Does solving it save users significant money or make them money? (Creates an immediate business case for a $10k/month MRR).
- **Mandatory:** Is the solution essential rather than a "nice-to-have"?
- **Frequent:** Do users encounter the problem repeatedly (daily/weekly)? High frequency leads to high retention.

*YC also advises to look for ideas that are newly possible due to recent changes in the world—which perfectly aligns with our focus on the current AI boom.*

## 5. Market Research & Unpacking Demand
Before writing a single line of code, we will perform aggressive desktop research to validate the problem space. We aim to answer: *Are people already trying to pay to solve this problem?*
- **Reddit & Niche Forums:** We will scour subreddits (e.g., r/smallbusiness, r/LawFirm, r/realtors) searching for complaints, "how do you handle X?" posts, and hacky spreadsheet workarounds. Where there is a spreadsheet, there is a SaaS.
- **Competitor Analysis:** Competition is a double-edged sword:
  - *No Competition:* Danger zone. It often means there is no market demand or people are fundamentally unwilling to pay for a solution.
  - *Too Much Competition:* Bloodbath. Customer acquisition costs (CAC) will be too high to gain traction quickly.
  - *The Goldilocks Zone:* Markets with old, clunky, poorly designed, or expensive incumbent software that we can disrupt with a fast, modern, AI-first alternative.

## 6. Distribution Strategy
Because we lack deep industry-specific connections, **Distribution is the Key**. A good idea without a realistic channel is a bad idea. Every idea must be evaluated alongside its distribution channel:
- If we build a tool for real estate agents, we know we can scrape Zillow and cold outreach directly via email/phone.
- If we build a generic consumer app, how do we reach them? 
- **Primary Channels:** 
  - **Cold Outreach:** Email, Direct Messages on LinkedIn/X. (Highly effective for B2SMB if the value proposition is sharp).
  - **Launch Platforms:** Product Hunt, Hacker News (useful for initial spikes, getting early feedback, and tech-forward B2C/prosumers).
  - **Online Communities:** Contextual posting in Reddit, Facebook Groups, Discord servers, and X (Twitter) communities.

## Summary Checklist for Evaluating an Idea
When we move to the brainstorming phase, every idea will be scored against:
1. [ ] Can an MVP be built ("vibe-coded") in 1–2 weeks?
2. [ ] Is there a clear, immediate paid path to $10k/month MRR without requiring millions of users?
3. [ ] Is the problem niche and urgent?
4. [ ] Does it leverage AI significantly to provide value?
5. [ ] Is the primary customer a Small Business or a Prosumer?
6. [ ] Is there a clear, accessible distribution channel (e.g., scrapeable emails, specific active subreddits)?

*Next Steps: Once we agree on this framework, we will proceed to brainstorming 10 ideas that strictly adhere to these criteria.*
