## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Dimension | Idea 1: Hyper-Local AI SEO Engine | Idea 2: AI Missed-Call SMS Receptionist | Idea 3: Conversational AI Intake (Law) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Target Customer** | Local home service businesses (plumbers, HVAC, roofers) | Solo/small-crew field service businesses | Boutique law firms, solo attorneys |
| **Core Problem** | Can't afford SEO agencies ($2-5k/mo); need local Google rankings | Physically can't answer phone while working; losing $1,200+ per missed call | Intake process wastes 1.5-2+ hrs of staff time per client; slow response loses leads |
| **Time to Customer ROI** | 3–6 months (SEO is slow) | **Day 1** (instant missed call rescue) | **Day 1** (structured Brief from first intake) |
| **MVP Build Time** | 2 weeks | **3–5 days** | 1–2 weeks |
| **Price Point** | $199–299/mo | $99–149/mo | $249–499/mo |
| **Customers for $10k MRR** | 34–50 | 68–101 | **20–40** |
| **Gross Margin** | ~90% | ~85–93% | **~95–97%** |
| **Problem Urgency** | Medium (important but not urgent) | **Extreme** (hair on fire, daily) | High (expensive time waste, lead loss) |
| **Problem Frequency** | Weekly/monthly check | **Multiple times per day** | 5–20x per month |
| **AI Moat Strength** | Medium | Medium | **Very Strong** |
| **Distribution Ease** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Google Maps scraping + cold email) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Google Maps scraping + "meta cold call") | ⭐⭐⭐ (bar registries, legal directories, cold email) |
| **Distribution Cleverness** | Good (free sample blog post) | **Brilliant** (cold call → prove the problem) | Good (live demo link) |
| **Churn Risk** | 🔴 High (3-6 month wait for results) | 🟢 Low (immediate, ongoing value) | 🟡 Medium (high expectations at $250+/mo) |
| **Technical Complexity** | Medium (GBP API, content engine) | **Very Low** (Twilio + LLM API) | Medium (chat UI, doc upload, PDF generation) |
| **Legal/Compliance Risk** | Low | 🟡 Medium (TCPA for auto-texts) | 🟡 Medium (data privacy, confidentiality) |
| **Market Competition** | Moderate & fragmented | High (~240 competitors) but fragmented | Active but gap exists for conversational AI |
| **Expansion Potential** | Other local business verticals | Auto repair, dental, vet, real estate | CPAs, financial advisors, therapists, immigration |

## Go / No-Go Verdicts

| Idea | Verdict | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Idea 1: Local SEO AI** | Conditional GO ✅ | Good idea, but the 3–6 month SEO lag creates high churn risk that directly conflicts with our "fast revenue" goal. |
| **Idea 2: AI SMS Receptionist** | **STRONG GO ✅✅** | Hair-on-fire problem, instant ROI, simplest MVP (3–5 days), brilliant distribution hack. |
| **Idea 3: AI Legal Intake** | GO ✅ | Strongest AI moat, highest ACV ($249–499/mo), excellent unit economics. Main weakness is harder distribution. |

## Recommended Build Order

| Priority | Idea | Timeline | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **#1 — Build First** | Idea 2: AI Missed-Call SMS Receptionist | Week 1 | Fastest MVP (3-5 days), most urgent problem, instant customer ROI, brilliant "meta cold call" GTM, lowest technical risk. Proves we can acquire SMB customers and generate revenue quickly. |
| **#2 — Build Second** | Idea 3: Conversational AI Legal Intake | Week 2-3 | Strongest AI moat, highest per-customer revenue ($249-499/mo), only 20-40 customers needed for $10k MRR. Can run distribution in parallel with Idea 2 since target audiences don't overlap. |
| **#3 — Build Third (or Deprioritize)** | Idea 1: Hyper-Local AI SEO Engine | Month 2+ | Solid market, great distribution channels, but churn risk from slow SEO results makes this the hardest to reach $10k MRR quickly. Revisit after Ideas 2 and 3 are generating revenue and we have more runway for patience. |

## Key Strategic Insight

**Ideas 2 and 3 can be built and sold in parallel** because they target completely different audiences (field service tradespeople vs. boutique law firms). The distribution channels, messaging, and product stacks don't overlap. This means we can potentially pursue both simultaneously within the first month.

**Idea 1 is the riskiest** not because the market is bad (it's great), but because the feedback loop is too slow. SEO takes 3–6 months to show results, and our framework explicitly prioritizes fast time-to-revenue. If a plumber pays $199/mo for 3 months and sees nothing, they cancel. This creates a structural churn problem that's hard to solve without changing the product's fundamental value proposition (e.g., adding instant-value features like review management or GBP optimization that show results faster).
