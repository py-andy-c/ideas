# Final Ranking Notes

**Author:** Project Manager
**Date:** 2025-02-25
**Inputs:** 32 deep dive analyses, 128 peer review feedback files (4 agents × 32 ideas), 4 cross-cutting summaries, original consolidated ranking CSV.

***

## Methodology

1. **Deep dives** were completed for 32 of the 94 long-listed ideas by independent AI agents.
2. **Peer review** was performed by 4 independent agents, producing 128 idea-specific feedback files and 4 cross-cutting summaries.
3. **PM synthesis** consolidated all feedback, adjusted framework scores, triaged ideas, and resolved redundancies.
4. **Analysis revisions** were applied to top-priority ideas (`analysis.md` updated in place).
5. **Re-ranking** reflects the post-review adjusted scores below.

The **individual `analysis.md`** in each idea folder is the single source of truth. This ranking is an index — it tells you which analysis to open first.

## Platform Strategy

### 🟢 Accounting Platform

**Buyer:** Accountants & bookkeepers
**Distribution:** QuickBooks ProAdvisor directory, LinkedIn, CPA communities, cold email
**Build sequence:** 80 (Data Janitor) → 89 (AR Chaser) → 33 (Document Chase) → 90 (Vendor Bill Auditor)
**Combined ACV potential:** $99–149/mo for the suite

### 🟠 Contractor Platform

**Buyer:** Home service contractors (plumbers, HVAC, electricians)
**Distribution:** Google Maps scraping, cold call/text, Facebook contractor groups
**Build sequence:** 43 (Lead Qualifier) → 2 (Missed Call as feature) → 21 (Quote Generator) → 71 (Construction Estimating)
**Combined ACV potential:** $149–199/mo for the suite

### 🔵 Legal Products

**Buyer:** Solo/small law firm attorneys
**Distribution:** State bar directories, LinkedIn, r/LawFirm, Clio marketplace
**Build sequence:** 64 (Contract Reviewer — standalone) and 39 (Intake + Conflict — platform entry)
**Note:** 64 and 39 serve different practice types (transactional vs. litigation). Both are viable as independent products.

### ⚪ Standalone Products

Ideas that don't bundle naturally but have strong independent potential:

* **48** (Auto Service Advisor) — exceptional "mystery shop" distribution
* **46** (AI Answering Service) — "replace Ruby" positioning, law firms first
* **69** (AI Billing Time Entry) — voice-first, lawyers

***

## Merged Ideas

| Deprecated | Merged Into | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| **Idea 68** (Legal Intake CRM) | **Idea 39** (Legal Intake + Conflict Check) | 4/4 agents + CSV consensus: same product. Conflict check = stickiness. CRM/follow-up = Phase 2. |
| **Idea 2** (Missed Call Textback) | **Idea 43** (Contractor Lead Qualifier, as a feature) | 240+ competitors. Zero tech moat. Only viable as "missed call capture" module in the contractor platform, not standalone. |

***

## Key Adjustments from Pre→Post Review

| Adjustment | Impact |
|---|---|
| MVP build times +50–100% | All ideas affected. "3–5 days" → 7–10 days. "2–3 weeks" → 3–5 weeks. |
| Trial-to-paid 15–20% (not 25–35%) | Unit economics updated. Time to $10k MRR extended 1–2 months for most ideas. |
| Incumbent window 3–6 months (not 12–18) | Urgency increased. Speed to first paying customer is existential. |
| Ideas 39/68 merged | One product, not two. Build conflict check first, CRM as Phase 2. |
| Idea 2 downgraded to HOLD | Saturated market (240+ competitors), zero moat. Only viable as contractor platform module. |
| Idea 48 elevated to top 6 | "Mystery shop" distribution strategy is underrated. Auto repair is underserved. |

## Remaining Long List (62 Ideas Not Deep-Dived)

The 94-idea long list (`idea_brainstorm_longlist.md`) still contains 62 ideas without deep dive analyses. Their preliminary scores are in `final_idea_ranking.csv`. To evaluate more:

1. Pick high-scoring ideas from the CSV that haven't been deep-dived
2. Assign agents using `DEEPDIVE_GUIDELINES.md`
3. Run peer review using `FEEDBACK_GUIDELINES.md`
4. PM synthesizes (this document's methodology)
5. Add to the ranking

**Pipeline is repeatable and documented.**

## How to Use This Ranking

**To build a product:**

1. Pick an idea from the Top 10 table above
2. Open its `analysis.md` in the corresponding `idea{ID}_slug/` folder
3. Hand the analysis to a coding agent — the MVP spec (Section 6) is buildable as-is
4. Follow the distribution strategy (Section 7) in parallel with development

**To evaluate more ideas:**

1. Open `final_idea_ranking.csv` → filter ideas without deep dives
2. Follow the pipeline described above
