# Feedback: Idea 86 — AI Insurance Claims Narrative Writer for Adjusters
**Reviewer:** agent2
**Date:** 2025-02-25

## Overall Impression

Strong analysis with a clear gap: Voltaire does letters, n2uitive does statement summaries, XactAI does assignment summaries — nobody does the full narrative report. The pain (5–20 narratives/day, 20–45 min each) is well-quantified. Distribution (3) is correctly scored — no scrapeable database. My main concerns: carrier-specific format compliance is complex, and the buyer (adjuster vs. carrier) affects sales motion. The verdict (Top Tier) is reasonable.

## Key Strengths of the Analysis

* **Clear competitive gap** — Voltaire (letters), n2uitive (statements), XactAI (assignment summaries), CLARA (risk notes). Full narrative = unserved. Compelling.
* **Pain quantification** — 5–20 narratives/day, 20–45 min each, 47% denials overturned. Regulatory pressure adds urgency.
* **Concrete example** — Hail damage input → output excerpt. Shows the AI capability.
* **Independent adjuster focus** — They control their tools. No carrier approval needed. Smart wedge.
* **MVP spec** — Claim input form, LLM generation, review UI. Buildable in 2 weeks.

## Critical Challenges & Disagreements

**1. Carrier-specific format is a rabbit hole.** The analysis says "carrier-specific format and terminology support" and "pre-built templates for top 5–10 carriers." But: State Farm, Allstate, Progressive, etc. each have different narrative structures, required sections, and terminology. A State Farm property narrative may require sections A–G; Allstate may require X–Z. Building 10 carrier templates = significant research and maintenance. **MVP recommendation:** Start with a *generic* narrative format that covers the 5 elements (loss, investigation, policy, coverage, recommendation). Let adjusters paste into carrier systems. Add carrier templates in Phase 2 based on customer demand. Don't over-build for V1.

**2. Distribution (3) — the real bottleneck.** There's no NAIIA "directory" that's easily scrapeable. LinkedIn "claims adjuster" returns many results, but filtering for independent adjusters (who buy their own tools) is manual. Insurance associations (CPCU, NAIC) have memberships but not public directories. The analysis is right to score 3. **Mitigation:** Partner with adjusting firms (IA firms that employ 10–50 adjusters). One firm = 10–50 seats. Enterprise-ish motion for a "solo" product. Or: Xactimate integration — adjusters already use it. Get listed in their marketplace.

**3. Policy citation accuracy is critical.** The narrative must cite correct policy language. If the AI cites the wrong exclusion or misstates a provision, the adjuster could face bad-faith claims or regulatory issues. The analysis says "policy excerpts: optional paste" — so the user provides policy language. Good. But: what if they don't? The AI might hallucinate policy language. **Mitigation:** Never generate policy citations without user-provided excerpts. If no excerpt, output: "[Insert policy language for [exclusion X] here]." Template placeholder, not AI guess.

**4. XactAI at $29–39/user** — The analysis says XactAI does "assignment summaries" not full narratives. But Xactimate is the dominant platform. If XactAI expands to full narratives, they have distribution (every Xactimate user) and integration. The analysis should add: "XactAI expansion to narrative generation is a key competitive risk." Monitor Verisk's roadmap.

## MVP Feedback

* **Carrier templates** — Defer to Phase 2. MVP: one generic template. Add carrier-specific in v1.1 based on customer requests.
* **Policy citation** — Require user to paste policy excerpts for any citation. No AI-generated policy language. Add to prompt: "Only cite policy language that appears in the user-provided excerpts."
* **Line of business** — Property / Auto / Workers' Comp have different narrative structures. MVP: Property only. Add Auto and WC in Phase 2.
* **Export** — PDF and Word. Adjusters need to paste into carrier systems. Word is more editable. Prioritize Word export.
* **Missing: Audit trail** — Adjusters may need to show "AI generated draft, I reviewed and approved." Add: timestamp, "Generated by AI, reviewed by [user]" footer. Compliance/audit requirement.

## Distribution Feedback

* **IA firm partnerships** — Independent adjusting firms (Crawford, Sedgwick, pilot programs) employ many adjusters. One partnership = 20–50 seats. Higher-touch sales but efficient.
* **Xactimate marketplace** — If Verisk has an app marketplace, get listed. Adjusters already in Xactimate would see the tool.
* **Insurance forums** — insurance-forums.com, r/InsurancePros. Value-first posts. "How I cut narrative writing from 45 min to 10 min."
* **CPCU / NAIC events** — Conferences where adjusters gather. Booth or session.

## Risks Not Addressed

* **Carrier adoption** — Some carriers may prohibit adjusters from using AI for narratives. "AI-generated content" could be a compliance red flag. Need: clear positioning that adjuster reviews and approves. "AI-assisted" not "AI-generated."
* **E&O insurance** — Adjusters have E&O coverage. Could AI use affect their coverage? Unclear. Worth a call to an insurance attorney.
* **n2uitive expansion** — They have 30+ carriers and 10K+ adjusters. If they add narrative generation, they have distribution. Monitor their product roadmap.
* **Regulatory** — State insurance departments regulate claims handling. AI-generated narratives could attract scrutiny. Stay within "draft for human review" framing.

## Suggestions & Opportunities

* **Per-narrative pricing** — $2–5 per narrative. Adjusters doing 5–20/day might prefer per-use over $79/mo. At 10/day × $3 = $30/day = $600/mo equivalent. Subscription could be cheaper. Test both.
* **Integration with Xactimate** — If Xactimate has an API or export, pull assignment data (loss type, policy, inspection notes) into the narrative tool. Reduces data entry.
* **Bundle with Idea 63 (Medical Chronology)** — Some adjusters (workers' comp) need both: medical record chronology + claims narrative. Same buyer in WC. Cross-sell opportunity.
* **Carrier pilot** — Approach a mid-size carrier for a pilot. "We'll run 100 narratives through our tool, your adjusters review. Measure time savings." Proof of value before broader rollout.

## Revised Scores (if applicable)

| Criteria | Original Score | My Score | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Distribution | 3 | 3 | No change — correctly scored as harder |
| MVP Buildability | 4 | 4 | No change — 2 weeks is achievable with generic template |
